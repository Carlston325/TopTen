            <h3>Spiderman Homecoming</h3>
            <p>
                Spiderman Homecoming is one of my favourites because it was differnet and something fresh compared to the other Spiderman movies. 
                Although he goes through hardships in the movie, but compared to the other spiderman moveies or even the comics Peter in 'Homecoming' 
                feels more like a normal teenager in this moveis. He is going through hardships that other teenagers would also go through and so he feels more relatable 
                than the other Peter Parkers from the other moveies and comics.
            </p>

            <h3>Iron Man</h3>
            <p>
                I know there are more than one Iron Man moveies and I just wrote Iron Man so its a bit vague but to be honest I was thinking 
                mostly of the first one (which is named 'Iron Man', also the one I like most from them), but then I realised that actually I really 
                liked all the Iron Man moveies. I am very much into machinary and technology ( I as a 22 year old man still love watching planes fly 
                in the sky and I love sitting at the wing window seat looking at the engine). So when I first saw Iron Man it instantly became my favourite 
                right next to spiderman whom I adored as a kid.
            </p>

            <h3>The Avengers</h3>
            <p>
                I don't really have much to say about The Avengers since the reason I like it was because of Iron Man and Spiderman. The movie itself 
                was nice in general with a good story and some of the best graphics within movies.
